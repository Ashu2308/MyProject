				<h2>Audi New A4 Preview</h2>
					<p>The 2016 Audi A4 made its official debut at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show and will be launched for major European markets by the end of the year. Audi has unveiled the new Audi A4 at the Auto Expo 2016 held in Greater Noida and will launch the car in India in the calendar year 2016.</p>
					<h5>Exterior</h5>
					<p>The new car is based on the second-generation of the flexible MLB platform and looks sharper than the current A4 on sale. The latest iteration gets restyled headlamps, single-frame grille, chrome strip within the waistline, new alloy wheels, compact LED tail lamps and a sloping roofline. The matrix LED headlamps will also be available as an optional extra. Overall, the different changes will bring a fresh look to the car, still following the design language and styling of the existing model.</p>

				<h2>Tata Hexa Preview</h2>
					<p>Since the launch of the Zest compact sedan, Tata has not looked back at its old rusty and crude self. The Hexa will certainly benefit with the renewed focus on quality and the new design language – Horizon Next. The latest SUV from Tata is based on the Aria and lends a fresh lease of life to the otherwise not so popular people mover.

The Hexa is a new SUV measuring 4,764mm in length, 1,895mm in length and 1,780mm in height. The vehicle has a long wheelbase of 2,850mm. The car's fascia boasts of newly designed projector headlamps, a honeycomb grille and new bumper with fog lamps. The horizontal chrome slat under the grille extends towards the headlamps and the honeycomb pattern can also be seen on the front chin.

Coming to the sides, the newly designed 19-inch alloy wheels can be seen. Though the overall design is similar to the Aria, the Hexa gets a sporty design language which is continued at the rear as well. The rear bumper, with dual exhaust tips, gets a dual-tone paint scheme with a new shape for the reflectors. The tail lamps are restyled and come with LED units. A new spoiler can also be seen at the back.

Inside the car, Tata has gone all black with silver coloured accents to give the interior a premium feel. It gets automatic climate control with a separate zone AC for the rear and third row passengers. The cabin is roomy and looks like the third row should be able to allow full-size adults to sit comfortably. The top-spec car will get leather upholstery, steering mounted controls for the infotainment system, electrically adjustable and retractable outside rear view mirrors. The audio system gets a display screen and seems to be sourced from the Zest.</p>

				<h2>Maruti Suzuki Ignis Preview</h2>
					<p>The Ignis, which comes from the parent car manufacturer Suzuki, will make its India debut at the Auto Expo. The car was first showcased as the Suzuki iM-4 concept at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show and later unveiled at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show.</p>
					<h5>Exterior</h5>
					<p>The minimalist body consists of plain surfaces and round roof with straight lines that give it a distinctive stance. The proportionate tyres jutting out at the four corners firmly support the body and hint at the car's muscular look. Dramatic features such as the front fascia with its sunglass-clad look, the shell-like roof, and the attractive slits on the C-pillar accentuate its exterior. The Maruti Ignis will measure 3,700mm in length, 1,660mm in width, 1,595mm in height, 2435mm in wheelbase and feature 180mm of ground clearance. The car will also get LED daytime running lights.</p>
					<h5>Interior</h5>
					<p>The Ignis will get typical Maruti Suzuki black interiors with silver accents. The interior quality will be very similar to that of the Maruti Suzuki Swift in India. The car will get automatic climate control, a modern touchscreen SmartPlay infotainment system equipped with USB and BlueTooth connectivity, reverse parking sensors and a multifunction steering wheel. The Ignis will be very similar to the Swift in terms of equipment.</p>
					<h5>Engine and gearbox</h5>
					<p>The India-spec Ignis will receive the 1.2-litre K-Series petrol engine and the 1.3-litre DDiS diesel engine with a 5-speed manual gearbox. The petrol engine makes 83bhp and 115Nm of torque while the diesel makes 74bhp and 190Nm of torque in the Swift. The figures may vary in the Ignis as it could get a different state of tune. It may get an optional CVT gearbox.</p>

				<h1>Skoda Rapid Facelift Preview</h1>
					<p>It has been more than four years since the launch of the Rapid and Skoda is readying the facelift of the C-segment sedan for a 2016 launch. This will be the first significant facelift for the sedan that has been regularly tweaked and updated by the Czech manufacturer. The Skoda Rapid will now resemble its larger siblings – the Octavia and Superb.

The front fascia has become sharper with a restyled grille and the almost rectangular headlamps. The front bumper and the fenders have been reworked for the edgy look. The tail lamps have been tweaked as well and the rear bumper sculpted to complete the new look. The sharp edges gives the Rapid a sleek and premium look moving away from the Fabia-esque look of the current car.

On the inside, we do not expect many changes. While the dash will be tweaked to go with the edgy exterior, it will get the Climatronic climate control system with dust and pollen filters along with AC vents for the rear passenger. The Skoda Rapid facelift might get new features like a new Mirror Link touchscreen infotainment system with a reverse camera option, cruise control and rain sensing wipers. In terms of safety, the new Rapid will offer standard airbags and ABS with EBD. The facelift model might also get electronically adjustable and foldable ORVMs.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you will have two engine options with both manual and automatic transmissions. It will continue to get the 1.6-litre four cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine that develops 104bhp of power and 153Nm of torque. The 1.5-litre turbo-diesel which also develops an identical 104bhp of power but 250Nm of torque will also continue to be offered. Both engines are mated to a five-speed manual gearbox. In case of automatic transmissions, the petrol comes mated with a six-speed DSG while the diesel is mated to a seven-speed DSG unit.

The Skoda Rapid has been pitched against the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, the Honda City and the Hyundai Verna along with its twin, the Volkswagen Vento. Also in the fray are the Renault Scala and the Nissan Sunny. The facelifted Rapid is expected to be priced competitively and marginally above the current car.

				<h2>Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cabriolet</h2>
					<p>Mercedes-Benz is the first of the global luxury manufacturers to come to India. Indians have a soft corner for the three-pointed stars and Mercedes has responded by gradually getting its entire global line-up to India. Based on the S-Class coupe, the S-Class Cabriolet is another exotic in the bouquet of premium offerings.

The front fascia is that of the S-Class but with a thick chrome slat and the three-pointed star. The bumper gets aggressive creases to suit the sporty character of the convertible. The long hood, raked windshield, four seats and the stubby boot are a perfect recipe for the side profile of a classic roadster.

It is an S-Class and the flagship drop-top offered by Mercedes globally. Luxury, hence, comes in abundance. The pure white Nappa leather interiors laced with wooden inserts and top quality plastics give the S-Cabriolet cabin a classy and plush look. We need not really talk about the equipment and features as the top of the line convertible gets everything from automatic intelligent LED headlamps with DRLs, power seats with memory function, three-zone climate control et al. The electrically operated roof opens or closes in 20 seconds and can be operated up to speeds of 60kmph. The state of the art Burmester audio system floats with the roof to offer the best of music experiences with the roof closed or open.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you have the 4.7-litre twin-turbocharged petrol V8 engine powering the rear wheels. The 449bhp of power and 700Nm of torque are transferred through a nine-speed automatic gearbox. As for the safety, you have the Mercedes safety web of dual-stage airbags and the electronic stability program with a host of features including ABS-EBD with brake assist, anti-skid control, traction control, hill-assist and adaptive cruise control with emergency braking.

After the showcase at the 2016 Auto Expo held in Greater Noida, the S-Class cabriolet will be launched soon and should be priced upwards of Rs 2 crore in India. The S-Cabriolet competes with the Bentley GTC, the Maserati Gran Cabrio and the Ferrari California in terms of the expected price tag.</p>

				<h2>Toyota New Fortuner Preview</h2>
					<p>The current Fortuner has been on sale in the Indian market since 2009 and thanks to its muscular and rugged looks, has a good fan following. Toyota has now officially revealed their most anticipated product of the year – the 2016 Fortuner. Like the current generation Fortuner, the 2016 version of SUV is also based on the Hilux platform and boasts of a new design and big list of features.</p>
					<h5>Exterior</h5>
					<p>The next-gen variant of the Fortuner gets a complete design overhaul and looks sharper than the present model. The fascia sports a new two-slat grille that extends up to the headlamps and has flanks that taper over the headlights. Toyota has equipped the Fortuner with LED daytime-running lamps and the top-end model will also get Bi-LED projector headlamps. These sweptback projector headlamps are surrounded by chrome embellishments to add to the bling factor.

The bumper is redesigned and gets a new black air dam while the fog lamp housings are surrounded by thick curved aluminium accents. On the side, Toyota has given the new Fortuner a floating pillar-less roof design that makes the SUV look quite interesting and attractive. The rear end also gets a similar slim-cut treatment with sleek tail lamps. The vehicle will be available with 17-inch and 18-inch wheel options.</p>
					<h5>Interior</h5>
						<p>And it’s not just the exterior, but Toyota has completely redesigned the cabin of the Fortuner as well. The dashboard layout is new and the instrument cluster comes with a multi-information display. The center console is vertically-oriented with a touch screen entertainment system, automatic AC controls, and a lot of storage spaces. The new three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel comes with audio controls and the car gets a new key fob. Higher variants are likely to come with rear parking sensors, keyless smart entry and start, downhill assist control, a powered tailgate and 18-inch alloys with highway tyres.</p>
					<h5>Engine and gearbox</h5>
					<p>One of the major changes on the next-gen Fortuner will be Toyota’s new GD series engines. The new 2.4-litre turbo-diesel is expected to replace the current 2.5-litre diesel unit, and a 2.8-litre mill will replace the current 3.0-litre unit. The new 2.4-litre 2GD-FTV motor is rated at 148bhp of power and 400Nm of peak torque. The 2.8-litre 1GD-FTV engine churns out 175bhp and 450Nm of torque. Depending on the variant, the transmission includes a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic.</p>
					<h5>Price and Competition</h5>
					<p>Toyota Kirloskar Motors will bring the car to the 2016 Auto Expo in India and might also launch it for the Indian market. It is expected to be priced in the Rs 25 lakh to Rs 28 lakh price bracket and will then lock horns with the Ford Endeavour, Mitsubishi Pajero Sport and the upcoming Chevrolet Trailblazer.</p>
